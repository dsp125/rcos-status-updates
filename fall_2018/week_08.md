## Notes

> I'm using this section to summarize what I've done as I believe that my commits do not appropriately 
reflect the work I've done. I struggled through this project as there was a lot to learn before I could 
even start coding. I needed to gain an understanding of how graphics engines work to even begin to understand
the project. Setting up the environment was a project in itself. There were many issues in just getting the 
current code working.
