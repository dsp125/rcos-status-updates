## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I fixed the current build by reinstalling Vulkan. Asher believes a Windows update may have caused errors in Vulkan. The changes
I made in the reverted version of the code didnt hold up in the fixed build. I will need to fix these changes. These changes are in the SparseMap
class that I made to replace the AbstractSparceSet and AbstractSparceEntity classes. Hopefully I will finally be able to move onto Vertex Buffer work
soon.

## This Week's Plan

> Fix SparseMap class. Throw Finalize changes to Vertex Buffer class.


## Anything Blocking?

> Navigating code is still a difficult issue to deal with for me. This is slowing down my progress significantly.

## Notes

> Will be pushing my changes, working or not, to my branch soon.
