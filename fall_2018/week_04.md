## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Attempted vertex buffer implementation. Ran into errors due to poor understanding of how vertexes are implemented in the existing solution.

## This Week's Plan

> implement vertex buffers. Look into uniform buffers


## Anything Blocking?

> Implementing tutorial code with existing code is proving to be a struggle 

## Notes

> Learning fundamentals of graphics APIs, more specifically about vertex classes, their manipulation, and vertex buffers.
