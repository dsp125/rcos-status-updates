## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished cleaning up the class structures on my system by reverting to an older version of my build. The current version is throwing
an exception that I cant figure out so I will be contacting Asher about resolving this. 

## This Week's Plan

> Move on to Vertex Buffer Implementation and finally fix the current build. 


## Anything Blocking?

> Not being able to change the current build has been a major issue for me. I need to do better on finding time to meet with Asher as its been 
hard to sync our schedules.

## Notes

> Presentation this Friday!
